Some time ago I thought about making a web project. More in the front-end field. I was wondering how I could make this task really simple to mantain but more important than that, I wanted it to be as fun as possible.

I thought, it needs a news/blog system, maybe a comments section and some static pages.

A CMS looked like the best option, Wordpress or Joomla came across my mind. But, was that fun? I don't think so.

Executing a installation wizard and clicking yes to all is not fun.

So I thought, what if I make myself a Markdown->HTML->Formatted HTML converter? Seemed like a good idea

Maybe someone already done that. I googled it and there it was, Jekyll.

This framework had a really simple setup:

```
gem install jekyll
```

And it had a really nice templating system called Liquid.

So I installed it right away, tweaked the HTML and the CSS using FontAwesome and MaterializeCSS, added a Disqus comment system and here it is, my personal site with a blog section.

The best part of this adventure, is that Github Pages supports Jekyll natively and I can upload my Jekyll source files instead of the static generated pages.

Jekyll not only gave a new way of blogging to me, a hacker type of guy, but it also made content management more fun.
