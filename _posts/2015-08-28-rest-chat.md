So, one day, I decided to make a chat, and why not?, it could be a REST service!  
\\
In terms of security, it's not really secure, as it could be DDoS'ed really
simply, but in terms of learning I thought it would be a really rich experience.  
\\
So the API would work like this:  
\\
I would have two paths:  
    - /getMessages  
    - /sendMessage  
\\
The first one would return to me a list of messages, each message would have an
**ID** and the **content**. If an integer argument is passed we would return
just only the message corresponding to that ID.  
\\
The second one would take an argument of a percent-encoded string, storing it
in the database.  
\\
I based this message system on the *4chan* message board. Users are
"completely" anonymous and they would refer to each other using the message ID.  
\\
So, we define our first test:  
{% highlight scala %}
"The REST api" should "return an empty list on GET when there are no messages" in {
  Get("/getMessages") ~> avocadoRoute ~> check {
    responseAs[String] should be("")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And now, we write the code to pass it:  
{% highlight scala %}
package com.nickseagull.avocado

import akka.actor.Actor
import spray.routing._
import spray.http._
import MediaTypes._

class AvocadoServiceActor extends Actor with AvocadoService {
  def actorRefFactory = context
  def receive = runRoute(avocadoRoute)
}

trait AvocadoService extends HttpService {
  val avocadoRoute = {
    get {
      pathSingleSlash {
        respondWithMediaType(`application/json`) {
          complete("")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Defining this service in a trait and not in the actor itself allows us to make
our REST API more modular, and in case that our project grows, we would not have
an enormous file containing all of our routes.  
\\
Now, we define our second test:  
{% highlight scala %}
it should "be able to POST a message" in {
  Post("/sendMessage/message") ~> sealRoute(avocadoRoute) ~> check {
    responseAs[String] should be("Message sent successfully")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And we write the code for it:  
{% highlight scala%}
trait AvocadoService extends HttpService {
  val avocadoRoute = {
    path("getMessages") {
      get {
        respondWithMediaType(`application/json`) {
          complete("")
        }
      }
    } ~
    path("sendMessage" / Segment) { message =>
      post {
        complete("Message sent successfully")
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
As we can see, Spray has a really straightforward API, and for the sake of
brevity, we will not write all of our code in this post, but only the important
part.  
\\
Now we need our database set-up.  
I made a singleton just for being quicker, but the correct way should be doing
it with some monads to encapsulate side-effects.  
\\
So, we connect to our database, and to the collection "messages":  
{% highlight scala %}
val messages = MongoClient("localhost", 27017)("avocado")("messages")
{% endhighlight %}
**Casbah** provides some really nice way to connect to it.  
\\
We define a method to get all our messages:
{% highlight scala %}
def getMessages:List[Message] = messages.find().map(buildMessage).toList
{% endhighlight %}
Ahhh, one liners, how I love you :)  
\\
But, what is **buildMessage**?  
{% highlight scala %}
def buildMessage(x: DBObject): Message = Message(getId(x), getContent(x))
def getId(x: DBObject): Int = x.getAs[Int]("_id").getOrElse(-1)
def getContent(x: DBObject): Int = x.getAs[String]("content").getOrElse("")
{% endhighlight %}
Of course all of them are **private**, we don't want anyone to use these.  
\\
To get just **one** message we could write this:  
{% highlight scala %}
def getMessageById(id: Long): Message =
  buildMessage
  messages.
  findOne(MongoDBObject("_id" -> id)).
  getOrElse(MongoDBObject("_id" -> -1,"content" -> "Message not found"))
{% endhighlight %}
To send a message I succumbed to **mutability** (OH NO!). In my defense I want
to say that I did it because I didn't want to mess with monads in Scala as I did
not have previous experience using them in this language. And, before you say it,
no, passing the DB connection from one function to another was not an option.  
\\
So I added a **var** (dang, it hurts me more than it hurts you) to count the
number of messages.  
{% highlight scala %}
var messageCount = 0; // THIS IS EVIL!!!
{% endhighlight %}
And I added a **sendMessage** method:  
{% highlight scala %}
def sendMessage(m: String) = {
  unsafeInsertMessage(m)
  true
}

private def unsafeInsertMessage(m: String) {
  val message = MongoDBObject(
    "_id" -> messageCount,
    "content" -> m
  )
  messageCount+=1 // More evil
  messages.insert(message)
}
{% endhighlight %}
Oh, and of course, a **clear** method to erase all of the messages.
{% highlight scala %}
def clear {
  messages.drop()
  messageCount = 0
}
{% endhighlight %}
After this we just need to write some more tests and finish our REST API.  
\\
You can see the *"finished"* project on my **GitHub**. (I say "finished" because I
need to "exorcise" all of that evil mutability from the code and add some monads
someday).  
\\
Thanks for reading!
