Not so long ago, I used to be very skeptic about AI. I didn't like the fact that to make an algorithm think, you had to impose to it a set of rules.

For me, that wasn't thinking, for me, that was something a bit better than a **HashMap** with the conditions and callbacks.

**I didn't like Artificial Intelligence.** (*Oh my gawd!*)

I was really into **Audio Synthesis/Processing**, I'm a musician, and working with code that makes the things that I like was a really appealing idea to me.

But one day, **everything changed**...

I met **Cayetano Guerra**, my AI teacher at **ULPGC**, and he made me have an epiphany.

Suddenly, every bad thought that I had about AI has disappeared, and made me love AI the most, to the point that I **dropped** the thought about working with Audio and made me want to dedicate myself full time to AI.

He introduced me to **Deep Learning**, and Machine Learning in general. 

My idea of making an heuristic for an AI just *poofed*. I wanted to **know** and **work** more with these awesome technologies.
**Even better**, while most of my classroom was doing heuristics for a **Chain-Four** game, I started to tinker with my first neural network for generating a text. I felt the same emotions as when I was 12 and discovered programming.

Machine Learning is one of the most amazing fields in **CS**.

Now I'm expanding my "toolbox". I'm learning more techniques like **Genetic Algorithms**. And I'm really looking forward to do something with reinforced learning like **Q-Learning**.

If someday you feel like you are (insert bad qualificator here) because you don't like anything and you are just looking how your life goes by, maybe it's just a matter of meeting new people. :)

And you, have you made a new mind today?
