title: WTF, a garage?

Some people call their sites homepage, others blog, some fancy folks call it digital garden.

In my case I call it _"Garage"_.


To me, a homepage, a blog, or a digital garden evokes some kind of order, commitment, or maintanance.
While a garage is this place where you put the stuff you like, even if it is out of fashion, and at
some point a friend might be looking at _stuffs_ in your garage and find something interesting.
