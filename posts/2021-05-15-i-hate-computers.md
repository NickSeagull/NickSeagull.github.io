title: I HATE COMPUTERS
author: Nick

Since a couple of years ago, this has become one of the sentences that I say the most.

Using technology nowadays, has become more of a needed burden for me, rather than something I
enjoy doing. When I truly enjoy using a computer is when I don't really think about it. Perhaps,
this is the root of all problems. Let's exemplify to get a bit more concrete:

I'm focused on some task, and I need to take a note on something, I open up Notion, and it takes
a lot to load, then I take the note in it's appropriate section, making sure that it is properly linked
to other relevant notes, but the link autocompletion is taking a lot, and I go to the internet to
find a proper solution for this so the next time it doesn't take that much time.

Another time, I sit in my car, about to ride somewhere, and I open Spotify: "No internet connection",
although I'm paying premium and all my playlists are downloaded for offline listening.

I'm in the hardware store, so I take out my phone to check OneNote for the stuff I need to buy:
"An issue has occurred while syncing your notebooks".

Open my calendar app to check today's meetings at work, and I end up waiting at 1pm for a meeting
that has been cancelled a week ago, and of course, only appears in the app, and not on the Google
Calendar's website.

Maybe while coding I get stuck in some problem that I have to think, and suddenly I find myself
binge-checking Reddit threads on similar topics.

Or I go to YouTube to check some specific lecture/talk on a topic I'm learning, and I end up on an
endless streak of "TikToks that made me cry laugh at 2am" videos.

All of these situations end up in the same sentence:

> \*sigh\* I hate computers...

What has gone so wrong?

Back when I started playing with computers and programming, everything was so smooth. I just
opened up Visual Basic 5, did my stuff, played my music on the Windows Media Player with the
green head skin, and when I wanted to "automate" stuff in the videogames I played, I just used
Notepad++ with Perl or AutoHotkey.

If I wanted to remember something for the next day, I just took a note on a piece of paper, and
that was it.

# The problem

The problem aren't computers, phones, technology or whatever, but the process I have acquired over
the years. Years of striving towards a perfect process and workflow.

As many issues in life, it is not something acquired from one day to another, but years of adding
tools/processes mindlessly into my digital life.

From subscribing to lots of Subreddits and Twitter accounts just in case I miss something on some
specific topic, to organize myself using a [super complex organization workflow](http://iteroni.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM)
that doesn't even fit in how I live my life and the things I do. As well as adding apps just because
their individual value propositions, but never thinking in how adding them to my toolbox would affect
my life.

# It's not about usefulness, it's about autonomy

Months of introspection didn't help finding the issues, but starting reading this book that I had
been recommended for the 5th time, Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.

I was super skeptic to start reading this book. Especially because I thought that I was using the
minimal possible tools that I needed.

Anyways, I started reading the book, and it wasn't much for the tools that I was using, but rather
my relation with them, and how I was using them as a clutch for my life, rather than using them as
tools when it was needed.

I was completely reliant on tools like Notion to remember that I had to fold my clothes, or relying
on Keyboard Maestro to switch Discord theme from light to dark. And when something failed, I had to
fix it, right in the moment.
